# Working from the latest version of the Replit docs

To ensure that you are working from the latest version, you should pull the latest changes down to the master branch of your fork before creating a new one.

First push any changes that you've made on your current branch up to the remote.

Now change to the master branch

And see if you are 'behind'. In this case, there are 19 new commits in master that we don't have so we need to pull those in by pressing the pull button.

Now you can create a new branch which will include all the latest chnages

If you change to master and it tells you that things are 'up to date' then you can simply make the new branch without pulling first.

We do "standups" asynchronously on Slack, preferably daily. Standups are to 

* Keep everyone in sync - people are curious about what their teammates are working on and can often help out or provide some insight relating to a point.
* Avoid being blocked on the same thing for too long - if your daily update is the same for a while, it's a good indiciation that you need to break something down more or get help
* Avoid things being forgotten - while we use Trello and other tools to help keep track of the bigger picture, standups provide a good summary of where things are and what is "work-in-progress" at any moment

Standups are **not** there to monitor you or make sure you are doing "enough", so don't feel pressured by them.

Standups are optional but encouraged. I use mine as my own to-do list for the day and check back on it during the day and often the day after (while I am writing the next one) as a way of keeping track and adjusting/correcting my own time estimates.

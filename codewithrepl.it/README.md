# Updating the codewithrepl.it site and book

We have 

- https://codewithrepl.it - a site for people looking for coding projects and tutorials
- https://leanpub.com/coding-with-replit/overview - the tutorials in book form on LeanPub

The book chapters are slightly different from the articles - they refer to 'the next chapter' and 'the previous chapter' and gifs are replaced by screenshots where possible and linked to separately.

## Updating the website

* [here is a commit](https://github.com/ritza-co/code-with-replit-articles/commit/dd5c6d11bef5de8496b17ddca7efcaa7e6273ee0#diff-747a8f398395dde8e524d9f983784bd8441c5cfe4307b5a079be5412ee65c314) which shows adding a new article to the site. Cover images are created with Canva.

To add a new article, create a similar pull request to https://github.com/ritza-co/code-with-replit-articles (in the 'website' subdirectory). The site is manually deployed, so ping Gareth once you're done so he can push it live.

Note that we have been editing the .css and .html files directly instead of following the original NodeJS build process.

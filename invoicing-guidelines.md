# Invoicing guidelines

Your invoice needs to follow some standard requirements, including: the invoice date, a description of services provided, a sequential invoice number,
your contact details, and our contact details. It should also contain your international bank details (see note about countries we can pay to below).

### Contact details
Please make the invoice out to 

```
Ritza
Herestraat 106
9711LM
Groningen
The Netherlands
```

and email it in PDF format to invoices@ritza.co

## Payment

We pay via EFT (South Africa), ACH (United States), or SEPA (IBAN) transfers (most of Europe). We cannot pay via PayPal, Crypocurrency, or any other custom provider.

You will not be charged transfer fees and will receive the full agreed amount. If you are in South Africa and have not received money from abroad recently, you will 
need to fill out a short online form which will be emailed to you after the payment is made.

## Dates

We invoice on the last working day of every calendar month. Please allow 3-5 days for the balance to reflect in your account. We use Wise (formerly TransferWise) 
for all payments, so the payment will reflect instantly if you use them for incoming payments.

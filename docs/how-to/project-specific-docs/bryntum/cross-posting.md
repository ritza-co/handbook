# Cross posting

## Medium

* We cross post articles after they have been published on the blog on Medium.
* The Ritza.co services@ritza account has access to submit to the Bryntum publication, so get access to that account.
* Create a new draft and copy from the markdown, one section at a time, as if you copy the entire thing, the code blocks will not always get the correct formatting
* For each code block, add three backticks which creates a new code block in medium and copy the code from GitHub. You can use the 'copy code block' button for this

* Still images should copy across automatically, but webm and mp4 files will not. Save these locally and convert them to .gif, e.g. using https://cloudconvert.com/webm-to-gif.
* Check that all links and images and code samples etc are as expected

Submit the publication to Bryntum

Add topics like JavaScript, Gantt Chart, or something else that is relevant. Look for the topics taht are most popular, e.g. here pick "Gantt Chart" because it has way more uses than the other options.

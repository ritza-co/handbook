# Bryntum tweets guide

Every week, early in the week, we need 7 tweets complete in the [`External doc`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnolV69AqvR76GA9kTwmSCGjPgKnl-lIPrj8E7aHm0M/edit#), ready to be posted for the following week.

Every week needs:

- 4 tweets about Bryntum products (Mon, Wed, Sat, Sun)
- 1 tweet about an interesting story in tech preferably webdev news (Tues)
- 1 tweet with a codepen demonstrating something cool or useful for the frontend (Thurs)
- 1 Fun Friday tweet with meme (Fri)

## Bryntum Product tweets

Every week we right four tweets about the features of these six Bryntum products:

- Gantt - https://bryntum.com/products/gantt/examples/
- Calendar - https://bryntum.com/products/calendar/examples/
- TaskBoard - https://bryntum.com/products/taskboard/examples/
- Scheduler- https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/
- Scheduler Pro - https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/examples/
- Grid - https://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/

Each tweet needs:

- A description of a Bryntum Products feature, with some emojis
- A link to the described Bryntum product feature (see the links above)
- A 16:9 video demonstrating the use of that feature, recorded in the Bryntum banner maker
- These hashtags: #react #vue #angular #js

Here is an example tweet (please note the header is not included in the tweet):

```

#react #vue #angular #js
```

All Bryntum product tweets should follow this format. Please make sure to use a descriptive header for the tweet so that you will be able to easily search the tweets document and find out if you have tweeted about this feature before.

Each product should be tweeted about evenly, ensuring not to tweet about the same product twice in the same week, and ensuring, if possible, that you have not tweeted about any product feature before.

### Recording with the banner maker

The banner maker software, found [here](), needs some setup before use.

- The `Show bryntum logo` option should be selected
- The appropriate demo title should be put into the `Title` option (e.g. TaskBoard Columns demo)
- The `Framework` option should be set to `Javascript`
- The `Size` option should be set to `LinkedIn 1200x675`

The people at Bryntum are proud of their product and so they them to be shown in their best possible form. However, the banner maker software provided does not always do a good job of displaying the Bryntum products.

Sometimes it is enough to put the link to the demo (e.g. https://bryntum.com/products/taskboard/examples/columns/) in the `iframe` found by enetering the developer tools with (`command + option + i`).

![Open banner maker dev tools](https://i.ritzastatic.com/images/5732f1a545ce4d9085824b579e2fe750/banner-dev.mp4)

Then you can demonstrate using the product while recording the banner at 16:9 aspect ratio.

![Record the product feature](https://i.ritzastatic.com/images/0c146a9114aa4cfab271dea586e02c3c/record-feature.mp4)

But sometimes the UI can be squished by the banner maker, making the product look bad. As you can see in the video above, The TaskBoard's tasks are squished and so you cannot read the text within them. Keep an eye out for this.

If the UI is squished you need to record using the product a different way. To record the product without a squished UI, open your browser and place it over the iframe of the banner maker, making it match perfecty horizontally, but slightly bigger vertically.

![Record browser](https://i.ritzastatic.com/images/139a4f4389e74ec3802addc5c8cb3482/record-browser.mp4)

Now record the demonstration of the feature only within the broswer window. Once you have recorded that successfully, upload the video with the `upload.py` script, and put the link that is returned from that script into the `iframe` found in the developer tools of the banner maker. Once the link is in the `iframe` `src` then the video should appear in the `iframe`, if the video has black bars on the top of bottom, adjust the width percentage of the iframe until the video fits perfectly.

## Codepen tweets

The codepen tweets also need to link to the codepen and have a recording of the codepen being used along side some of the code. This video must be recorded in the browser at 16:9 as well.

Here is an example tweet (Again, the heading is not a part of the tweet):

```

#html #css #ux
```

All videos and images must be run through the `upload.py` script, the link returned from that script is then used to link to an online version of the image in the [`External doc`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnolV69AqvR76GA9kTwmSCGjPgKnl-lIPrj8E7aHm0M/edit#).

Make sure to have these tweets ready early in the week before they will be tweeted, in order to allow for proofreading, checks, and adjustments.

## Tech News of the week tweets

Once a week we tweet about an interesting tech news story. The story should be related to frontend dev in some way.

Here is an example tweet:

```
# News üì∞

```

## Fun Friday tweets

On fridays we tweet a meme along with a short reaction, either some text and emojis or just emojis.

The memes are usually sourced from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) but of course you can source them from other places.

Please make sure the meme is high quality, that you have multiple choices for the people at Bryntum to choose from, and that you have not used the same meme in the past.

Here is an example tweet:

```
# Fun Friday

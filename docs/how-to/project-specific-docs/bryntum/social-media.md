# Social media

Social media goes through

* An engineering writer (writes tweets, creates demo videos)
* A proofreader (proofreading)
* A social media manager (uploading and scheduling)

We prepare posts in weekly batches, one week ahead.

* Monday: engineering writer drafts all tweets and creates all videos in the [internal] doc
* Tuesday: proofreading and sign-off from customer
* Wednesday/Thursday: schedule and upload

## Google doc notes

* Don't link text that should actually go into the posts - post the entire link rather as you can't link specific text in e.g. Twitter
* Attach graphics with a public link and ATTACH as the text.

## Checklist
* All Bryntum demos are using the banner maker tool
* Text, title, icons in demos are correct and don't have typos or spacing issues
* All media (demos and images) are relevant to the post and text (ie media is not mixed up due to copy-paste errors)
* All demos are < 5MB in size
* All images are high resolution and not pixelated
* Demos have aspect ratio of exactly 16:9
* Demos are high quality - 4k or retina
* Text is phrased as a call to action or question
* Text fits within Tweet length limits (note you can use fewer characters when using an image/video/link)
* Codepen links are forked to the Bryntum account

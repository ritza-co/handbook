# The Ritza-RU Award for Technical Writing

Ritza is offering a R5000 award for the best practical software engineering guide written by a student currently studying at Rhodes University.

**What:** Write a 2000-3000 word practical guide, including code samples, on how to build something interesting. A web application, a chatbot, a game, or anything else. Be creative. Also include screenshots if relevant. You can see some examples of the kind of articles we are looking for at the [CodeCapsules Documentation](https://codecapsules.io/docs/tutorials/) or the [Make JavaScript Games](https://makejsgames.com) website. The goal of your guide should be to teach, and you can find some more general information on the kind of writing we like [in our styleguide](https://styleguide.ritza.co/ritza%27s-writing-rules/Style/). 

**When:** Submissions are due by 1 August 2022

**What:** Write a 2000-3000 word practical guide on how to build something cool. It should contain step-by-step instructions, explanations of background concepts, and an accompanying code repository containing the final product. It doesn't have to be too ambitious: configuring a framework, using an interesting API, or combining several tools in a unique way. It shouldn't be a "getting started with React" or something that already exists: make it unique, and something that a competent coder couldn't figure out on their own in an hour.

**How:** You can write in any format you want, but we prefer [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can code in any langauge you want, and use any frameworks you want, but we'd prefer if you use free software and tools, so that readers can follow along and extend your work. Include all your work in a public repository on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Gitea, or similar, and email the link to gareth@ritza.co with exactly `Ritza-RU Submission` in the subject line.

We'll judge submissions on or before 15 August 2022. The winning entry will receive a one-time award of R5000, paid into a South African bank account. We reserve the right to not award the prize if no submissions meet the criteria outlined above.

# The Ritza-RU Award for Technical Writing

Ritza is offering a R4000 award for the best practical software engineering guide written by a student currently studying at Rhodes University. This will likely be most interesting to Computer Science students, but it is open to all undergraduates and postgraduates currently studying full time at Rhodes University.

Write a practical guide, including code samples, on how to build something interesting. A web application, a chatbot, a game, or anything else. Be creative. Also include screenshots if relevant. You can see some examples of the kind of articles we are looking for at the [CodeCapsules Documentation](https://codecapsules.io/docs/tutorials/) or the [Make JavaScript Games](https://makejsgames.com) website. The goal of your guide should be to teach, and you can find some more general information on the kind of writing we like [in our styleguide](https://styleguide.ritza.co/ritza%27s-writing-rules/Style/). 

**When:** Submissions are due by 1 August 2023

**What:** Write a 2000-3000 word practical guide on how to build something cool. It should contain step-by-step instructions, explanations of background concepts, and an accompanying code repository containing the final product. It doesn't have to be too ambitious: configuring a framework, using an interesting API, or combining several tools in a unique way. It shouldn't be a "getting started with React" or something that already exists: make it unique, and something that a competent coder couldn't figure out on their own in an hour.

**How:** You can write in any format you want, but we prefer [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can code in any language you want, and use any frameworks you want, but we'd prefer if you use free software and tools, so that readers can follow along and extend your work. Include the guide and example code in a public repository on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Gitea, or similar, and email the link to gareth-at-ritza dot co with exactly `Ritza-RU Submission` in the subject line.

We'll judge submissions on or before 15 August 2023. The winning entry will receive a one-time award of R4000, paid into a South African bank account. We reserve the right to not award the prize if no submissions meet the criteria outlined above.

**Why:** You are welcome to enter the competition even if you have no interest in doing further work for us, but we hope that partcipants might also be interested in working as an [engineering writer](https://ritza.co/handbook/roles/general-application/) either part time while you finish your studies or full time once you are done.

# Lesson and Instructions Authoring

Teachers may create read-only instructions for their students to follow as well as admin-only lesson plans to keep as notes and share curriculum with their peers using the Curriculum Authoring tool in their Team Project file tree.

To add Lesson Plan and Instructions files to your project, click on "Add Lesson Contents" as shown below:

The lesson contents are automatically created as shown below. Instructions and Lesson Plan files are written in markdown. You can find a handy guide to markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!

## Instructions

Instructions are view-only documents meant to provide guidance for students as they work on their projects. They are editable by Team admins in the `instructions.md` file.

Students will see the instructions in the pane next to their text editor.

To preview the lesson from a student's point of view, as an admin you can add a new non-admin member to your team for testing purposes. You can log in as the member in a different browser to keep the ‘teacher’ (admin) and ‘student’ (non-admin) separate and logged in at the same time.

## Lesson Plans

Lesson Plans are accessible only to admins in the `lessonplan.md` file. They are meant to provide speaker notes for individual teachers or guidance for teachers who may share curriculum with their peers or in the Curriculum Hub.

_Do not place project solutions in the Lesson Plan._

## Assets

The Assets folder contains images and other files to be used in the Instructions and Lesson Plans.

You can embed images from your Assets folder into your curriculum files like so: `![Image alt text](assets/imagename.png)`

# A quick explanation of terms

It is prudent to provide a quick explanation of the terms used in Teams for Education. This clarity is important as it may help to know the difference between terms such as "assignment", "lesson", "project" and "curriculum". The explanation will be by way of example using the creation of a lesson.

Curriculum Hub materials are designed to work as full units or as stand-alone projects.

## Example 1 - Creating a full unit

Let's say that a teacher wants students to learn Python the right way. So they want to create a complete course with a lot of different material for them to access during their learning. In Replit, the teacher would first create a unit. This unit would act as the container for the different "sections" or "topics" covered in the course. These "sections" can be represented as "projects" in Replit. 

As such, the teacher would then create a project and indicate the unit to which it belongs. Within a project, the teacher can create a lesson plan, instructions, and other learning resources such as chapters, as they see fit. Depending on how the teacher wants to structure the course, each project can include assignments or exercises for the students to work on and submit.

## Example 2 - Creating a standalone project

Another teacher may only want to teach students how to create a small game also in Python. As such, they can create a project in Replit, without having to create a unit, and add lesson content accordingly. Students can work on this project and submit their work for review.

In both these examples, the terminology used mainly depends on how the teacher wants to structure their course and in both cases, Replit provides for such flexibility.

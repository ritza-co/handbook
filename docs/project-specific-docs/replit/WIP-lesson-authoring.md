# Lesson and Instructions Authoring

Teachers may create read-only instructions for their students to follow as well as admin-only lesson plans to keep as notes and share curriculum with their peers using the Curriculum Authoring tool in their Team Project file tree.

To add Lesson Plan and Instructions files to your project, click on "Add Lesson Contents" as shown below:

The lesson contents are automatically created as shown below. Instructions and Lesson Plan files are written in markdown. You can find a handy guide to markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!

## Instructions

Instructions are view-only documents meant to provide guidance for students as they work on their projects. They are editable by Team admins in the `instructions.md` file.

Students will see the instructions in the pane next to their text editor.

## Lesson Plans

Lesson Plans are accessible only to admins in the `lessonplan.md` file. They are meant to provide speaker notes for individual teachers or guidance for teachers who may share curriculum with their peers or in the Curriculum Hub.

_Do not place project solutions in the Lesson Plan._

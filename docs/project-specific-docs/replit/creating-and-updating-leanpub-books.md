# Creating Leanpub Books

The following is a guide on how to create a book in pdf, mobi and epub format on Leanpub. 

## Getting Started

First create a GitHub repository which will house the markdown content for your book. In the root folder of the repository, create a `manuscript` folder to contain the `md` files for the chapters your book will have.

Content marketing has a lot of gray areas when it comes to ethics. Some questions that often get asked include:

* Should author's always get their name / a byline on their work?
* Should commissioned work be published under our customer's brands?
* Who owns the IP / copyright of written work?
* Is it OK for a company to partner with agencies to produce work and promote it as their own work?

## Ghost writing and attribution

Most of our writing is 'ghost' writing. It is often attributed to the brand of our customers (e.g. Acme Co), or to a specific person at that company. Sometimes it's attributed to "Ritza". Sometimes it's not attributed to anyone. Sometimes it's released under an open source license like MIT or Creative Commons.

Legally, our writers assign all the IP of the work they produce to Ritza, and Ritza has different agreements with different customers. In a majority of cases, we legally sell the IP and copyright of these works to them.

This can make writers who have a background in journalism or similar uncomfortable, as they generally think about writing as a creative output, and expect attribution and/or ownership of this. Ritza thinks about writing more in the way software engineers think about coding: it *is* creative, but it's often a team effort and trying to decide who owns which parts isn't practical. Engineers who write code either for their employer or as contractors usually do not expect to 'own' this work, even if it includes documentation, and sometimes also diagrams and other 'creative' components.

## Companies use our content to build trust in their brand

Sometimes, companies want experts to write guides, blog posts, ebooks and more as a way of winning their customer's trust. This might seem problematic: they perhaps don't have this expertise in-house, but their customers now think that they do?

This varies a lot on a case-by-case basis, but often it's better to think about this as them providing free education and training than about advertising their own in-house expertise. Places like Data Camp, Coursera, Udemy, and other online education providers often sell or give away 'knowledge', and this builds trust in their own brand even though they do not employ experts themselves. Most of our customers sell software or platforms, rather than consulting and selling their expertise, so for them giving away free education is a way to get brand recognition and trust. A company selling a data science platform does not necessarily need data experts, but they benefit from other experts in the field finding content created by their brand useful.

It might be useful to think of brands has being educational providers, similar to Udacity or Data Camp, and contracting Ritza to produce high quality materials. Writing and publishing is *hard* and not every company can spin up an internal team to do this, though places like Digital Ocean have done exactly this to great success.

### The problem of using individual writer's names

Some companies actually *want* to put individual writers names on our work. While this might seem like it comes from a place of good intentions, in reality it is usually because they want it to seem like individuals are advocating for their brand and to seem like this recommendation comes from a 'grassroots' level (sometimes known as [astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing). For this reason, and because often a team of 3+ people works on a single article, we usually prefer ghost writing, but assess requests on a case-by-case basis.

## Ritza's overall model

Ritza thinks that companies spend too much on traditional marketing - targeted ads, social media banners, and other adverts that provide no real value to the people who consume them. This is easy, well understood, and provides a clear return on investment to companies, so it's understandable why many choose this route.

Ritza's goal is to make it easy for companies to divert part of their marketing budget to produce value for the world. Companies should rather spend this money on providing free training and education - itâ€™s the best way to win favour from customers and even if 95% of people just walk away with the free knowledge/resources, the other 5% might remember the brand and become customers (or advocate that their team/company becomes a customer).

Some companies try to produce marketing like this internally, but this is difficult. Their own experts are too busy and often can't write well. They don't have editors on staff, and don't have good processes to produce high quality materials. If they try to do it internally, it's often unstructured and they end up with listicles or clickbait articles.

Overall, Ritza's "Three way win" means that 

* Our customers should get high quality materials that they can use to win customer trust and loyalty, and build brand awareness.
* Our writers should get consistent income, support from our team, while learning and improving their own knowledge and writing skills.
* Readers should get free education and training.

Because Ritza buys hours from writers and sell words to customers, writers get consistent income and our customers get consistent value each month.

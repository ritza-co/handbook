# One on ones at Ritza

In addition to our regular standup calls, you should have a one-on-one meeting with Gareth at least once per month.

This meeting is to check in on how things are going, and how things could be better or different. You can use this time however you think is most valuable, but some ideas below. It's helpful if you make some notes in a Google Doc and share them before hand so I can prepare as well.

While I'd like to meet everyone at least once a month, don't feel like you need to wait if you have something urgent to discuss. Feel free to ask for a 1:1 anytime you need help with something, big or small.

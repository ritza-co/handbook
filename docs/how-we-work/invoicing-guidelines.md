# Invoicing guidelines

Your invoice needs to follow some standard requirements, including:

* The invoice date
* a description of services provided
* the currency and amount
* a sequential invoice number
* your contact details
* our contact details. 

It should also contain your international bank details (see note about countries we can pay to below).

## Timelines 

We process invoices on the last working day of each calendar month. 

Invoices submitted before the 25th of that month will always be included.

Invoices submitted after the 25th will be processed the following calendar month. For example, if you submit your invoice on Friday 23 June 2023, it will be paid Friday 30 June 2023. If you submit your invoice on Monday 26 June 2023, it will be processed on Monday 31 July 2023.

If you have a retainer agreement for us for a fixed monthly number of hours, you can invoice for the entire month (e.g. including the hours you'll still complete between the 25th and end of month). 

If you have an hourly agreement with us, please invoice for the hours completed up to when you submit your invoice, and include any hours done after the 25th in the following month's invoice.

need to fill out a short online form which will be emailed to you after the payment is made.

## Checklist / common errors in invoices

- Full international bank details, including the exact name your account is in, and the exact full name of your bank.
- Note that common local abbreviations like "FNB" for "First National Bank" do not work for international payments
- Note that unlike for local payments, international payments are verified by **account name**, so use exactly the name of your account as it appears on your bank statements, and not an unofficial "trading as" name.

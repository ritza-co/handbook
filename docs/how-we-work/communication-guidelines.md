## Don't say hello in chat

Also see [NoHello.com](https://www.nohello.com). Async communication is in many ways the reverse of sync communication, and this is true for niceties as well. 
While it's important to be cordial and friendly, you can often invert normal social conventions and put **information up front** and **chit-chat afterwards** 
instead of the other way round. When a conversation takes place over hours or days, then:

```
Hi John, could you share that widget we discussed last week with me
(hi, by the way - how are things)
... wait
Hi Mary, here it is
(going great - how's there? Looking forward to the weekend tomorrow)
```

is much more efficient and respectful of each other's time than 

```
Hi John,
... wait
Hi Mary, how are you?
... wait
Good thanks. How's there?
... wait
```

## Default to including too many people than too few

To avoid three way conversations, always include anyone who might be relevant from the start. People in async environments are bottlenecked by responding to 
emails, slack threads, etc **not** by reading them so no need to 'save people's inboxes'.

## Make it clear when you are owning a decision or expecting someone else to to own it

'Shared' responsibility is inefficient and often people have strong opinions over small things. Be prepared to own certain decisions, deliverables, or 
conversations and don't spend excess effort getting to consensus (bias for action).

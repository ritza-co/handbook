# Frequently asked questions

**How are tasks assigned?**

Ideally, we have something close to a 1:1 matching between writers and customers. A writer will work on whatever is most important for their customer at any time. In the real world, it's not so simple. Sometimes we might need more than one writer for a customer, or a writer might support more than one customer, depending on how many hours per week the writer is working for Ritza, and how many words per month Ritza is producing for the customer.

Also, some customers require a range of different expertise. In this case, we might have many writers working on projects for one customer, depending on the tasks: frontend, backend, devops, specific frameworks, etc.

Sometimes customers want very repetitive, similar work, and a writer might start to get bored or burnt out. In cases like this we can also juggle things and swap writers between projects so that they both have something new and interesting to work on.

We are still small and generally we can optimize for all of our constraints at once, but not always. We borrow heavily from the [People First Jobs](https://peoplefirstjobs.com) principles and ensuring that our writers are enjoying their work is generally our top priority.

**What does the quality control process entail? if someone else on the team thinks, for example, that I should add an extra step to a tutorial, but I think that information would just cause unnecessary confusion, are there clearly defined steps for reaching a resolution?**

We haven't had any strong conflicts of opinion in case like this historically. In general:

* The writer is the "owner" of the draft and the QA engineer and editor will check any changes they aren't sure about before making them
* Sometimes the QA engineer or editor will ask the writer to have another read through after their edits to ensure that they haven't made any changes the writer disagrees with
* We use [our style guide](https://stleguide.ritza.co) by default
* Sometimes our customers have their own style guide, or want to make final editorial changes on their side after we have delivered
* We generally let customers do what they want to drafts after we have delivered them, unless it's unethical (e.g. using our content to lie about the capabilities of their product) in which case we will drop them.

# Time tracking

At Ritza we value honesty and we have complete trust in everyone in our team. We are completely against any kind of '[bossware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_monitoring_software)' and we assume that everyone fulfills the terms of their agreements with us.

Nonetheless, we still ask employees and contractors to keep basic time sheets and to submit these monthly. This is not because we don't trust that you are doing your hours. We use these time sheets

* For retrospective analysis and improvement on our estimates. For example, at some point we noticed that any project that involved the Microsoft stack (Azure, Power Apps, Sharepoint, Teams, etc) generally took much longer than our intitial estimates.
* To make sure we are offering fair value to our customers. While our contracts are in words, not all words are equal. For example, if we are editing existing documentation and we quoted a per-word rate but notice that way less editing time is being used than normal (because their existing content is already in good shape and only requires some light touch ups), then we offer them extra words for free, as otherwise we would be [extracting value](https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/principles/#we-create-value-we-dont-extract-it) which we don't do.
* To protect ourselves legally. In South Africa (and many other countries) there is sometimes a grey area between contracting and employment. The authorities use time sheets as evidence that someone is a contractor, not an employee, and they can request these for the previous five years. Without this, Ritza might be liable for payroll taxes which we have already paid directly to contractors.

## Tracking your time

You're welcome to use whichever tool you are most comfortable with to provide time sheets.

* We have a [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ScXlKUlj9Wz_bqUu4iuwpwqU8Xzzc8_qTQK_SZd1AWE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) that you are welcome to use.
* Some people prefer [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) or similar, which lets you export a PDF time sheet at the end of the month and share it with your invoice.

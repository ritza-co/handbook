# Types of editing we do at Ritza

At Ritza, we focus on the following three types of editing: proofreading, modern technical editing, and writer-development editing.

## Proofreading

The Ritza production process doesn't include a distinct proofreading phase. Instead, we ask our editors to pass the texts they have edited through a digital grammar- and spelling-correction tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). 

Proofreading is essential to pick up hard-to-see errors like:

* Transposition errors
* Errors of omission or insertion
* Grapheme substitutions
* Homophone errors
* Repeated or omitted articles
* Missing or unnecessary hyphens
* Missing or extra spaces between words

## Modern technical editing

Modern technical editing is our term for the type of editing we focus on at Ritza. A combination of copyediting and line editing, modern technical editing ensures that Ritza content is consistently as clear, accurate, and effective as possible. 

Technical editors at Ritza are expected to make all necessary changes to a text to ensure it meets our editorial style, which is outlined in our [style guide](https://styleguide.ritza.co) and frequently updated.

Modern technical editing includes:

* Rewriting sentences to improve structure, clarity, and flow.
* Improving writers' word choices to make writing stronger and more precise.
* Removing any words or phrases that dilute the impact of a sentence or make it wordy.
* Changing passive voice to active voice.
* Giving subsections descriptive headings.

Take a look at our [guidelines for technical editors](./editors-guidelines) for more detail about our approach to modern technical editing.

## Writer-development editing

Because building a team of strong writers is integral to the Ritza model, we invest in giving our writers hands-on, personalized writer-development support in the form of structural, substantive, and developmental editing and writer coaching.

Writer-development editing includes:

* 1:1 calls with writers.
* Collaboration on the writing process, including assistance with planning, outlining, developing an approach, structuring an argument, improving flow, and developing writing skills.
* Developmental feedback on drafts.

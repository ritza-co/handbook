# The Technical Project Manager role

Our principle "We are crafters, not overseers" means that we generally avoid having any 'hands off' roles, focused only on coordination or oversight.

The technical project manager 

* **Mentors:** They help junior writers and interns with their code and other technical matters. This includes reviewing code samples, helping people learn technical concepts and tools, and building new code samples.
* **Tracks:** They keep track of what work is being done, when different stages need to be completed, and identifies missed commitments before they happen.
* **Communicates:** They keep in close contact with all makers on a project and consoldate their work to prepare it for delivery and distribution.

As with other manager-roles at Ritza, Technical Project managers practice [servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) and actively stay aware of the [potential conflicts](../managers-and-makers) between managers and makers.

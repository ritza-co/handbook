# Standups

We do standups three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings to break articles into smaller tasks and set short-term goals. 

While our main project management is done on our ritza-articles board at an article level, it is helpful as a writer to avoid getting blocked and stay motivated by achieving smaller goals. Smaller tasks also allow for more collaboration as others can help or take over a smaller piece if necessary.

## Tasks

A task is a chunk of a project that 

* can be in more than three hours of work, but often less
* is a self-standing deliverable, that can be shared with the rest of the team for feedback and review
* is only a single kind of work, e.g. coding, writing, or research
* has a well defined 'done' state

Writers working an 8-hour day should schedule no more than 6 hours worth of tasks for a given day, e.g. a three-hour task for the morning and a three-hour task for the afternoon. 

### Good Examples of tasks are 

* coding: POC code pushed to github that demonstrates CRUD operations against the FooBar system
* writing: The CRUD part of the FooBar article, showing users how to create, read, update, and delete data from a system, 1000 words.
* A half page document summarizing learnings from some research about a new platform - e.g. how to onboard to it, whether a free trial or sandbox exists, the state of the documentation, and an estimate on how difficult it would be to integrate with some other platform
* Fixing the infinite loop bug

### Bad exammples of tasks are

* Working on foobar article
* Reading about the fizz platform
* Investigating the infinite loop bug 

## Weekly cadence

Because we meet three times a week, each session is only concerned with at most two days, or a max of four three-hour slots for a full time writer. So

- Monday morning, we estimate what we can do on Monday and Tuesday
- Wednesday morning, we estimate what we can do on Wednesday and Thursday
- Friday morning, we estimate what we can do for the rest of Friday

The weekly tracking is not meant to be long-term, so it's not important that everything is perfect and cleanly recorded. Old tasks can simply be deleted rather than sorted into the correct place. The outcome of a standup should be that everyone has a very clear idea of their goals for that day, and the next day.

## Sharing work in small pieces

Writers should post to `#ritza-team`, `#ritza-<customer>`, or `#ritza-<writer>` when they complete tasks, depending on who they would like to see the post. E.g. if it is something that is ready for editing or quality assurance, then it should be posted to `#ritza-<customer>`. If it's only partial progress towards and article that doesn't need input from anyone else yet then `#ritza-<writer>`.

When sharing work, writers should share both a short (often one sentence) summary of what they did, anything unexpected that changed the original esimate of that task, and a link to where the work exists, e.g. a GitHub link to code or markdown, a Google Doc link to a research summary. 

## Getting help

If a writer is stuck on something, they should ask in `#ritza-team`, `#ritza-<customer>` or `#ritza-<writer>` for help as soon as possible, either posting a detailed description of what they are stuck on so someone else can try to replicate the project to the point they are, or ask for a call with someone to walk through it together and try to figure out the issue.

# Standups

We do standups three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings to break articles into smaller sub tasks and set short-term goals. While our main project management is done on our ritza-articles board at an article level, it is helpful as a writer to avoid getting blocked and stay motivated by achieving smaller sub goals. Smaller tasks also allow for more collaboration as others can help or take over a smaller piece if necessary.

## Sub tasks

A subtask is a chunk of a task that can be reasonably achieved in no more than three hours of work, so in an 8-hour work day, someone should comfortably be able to tackle two subtasks and have some extra time for meetings etc.

If a subtask is estimated to take more than three hours, it should be broken up into multiple sub tasks. 

Example:

* Main task: "Work on the integrate foobar into bizbaz article"
* Sub tasks:
    * Write code for bizbaz article (10 hours)
    * Write article for bizbaz article  (5 hours)

If each of those is too large for a subtask, it could be broken up as:

* Figure out how to set up Foobar (2 hours)
* Get one data from foobar into bizbaz (2 hours)
* Write CRUD operations for bizbaz (3 hours)
* Write first 1000 words for bizbaz (3 hours)
* Complete draft of bizbaz (3 hours)

If any problems are found while coding or writing, these can be added as more subtasks, such as 

* Fix state issue with foobar article (2 hours)

## Weekly cadence

Because we meet three times a week, each session is only concerned with at most two days, or a max of four three-hour slots for a full time writer. So e

- Monday morning, we estimate what we can do on Monday and Tuesday
- Wednesday morning, we estimate what we can do on Wednesday and Thursday
- Friday morning, we estimate what we can do for the rest of Friday

The weekly tracking is not meant to be long-term, so it's not important that everything is perfect, and often we can just clear out previous stuff and start over if that's easier than categorizing and commenting on all previous tasks etc.

## Sharing work in small pieces

Even if your work isn't finished, once or twice a day share an update in #ritza-team along with the work you did, and anything that stopped you achieving a subtask. E.g. "I spent two hours on setting up Foobar, but it is paywalled so I couldn't get access, so I had to use a Sandbox. I thought this would take 2 hours in total, but it needs another 4 hours now probably as it is more complicated than I thought."

or "I wrote 600 words of bizbaz. I was aiming for 1000, but I found a bug in the write operation where it was creating duplicate tasks so I have to fix that. I pushed a fix for the code and will finish the write up tomorrow."

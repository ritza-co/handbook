# Expectations at Ritza

At Ritza, we offer a lot of flexibility. There are some general expectations though. This page aims to make them explicit as sometimes people interpret flexibility differently. Some of the expectations are negotiable in specific settings. Some are not.

## Non-negotiable expectations

These are baseline expectations that everyone should meet all of the time. If you cannot meet these, you are probably not a good fit for the Ritza team.

### Honesty

You should never lie or be dishonest about anything. 

- Don't cheat on your agreed hours. We pay for time and to a large extent we trust people to give us that time. We don't use monitoring software ("Bossware"), and we trust you to not lie about the number of hours you have given to Ritza.
- "I work smart not hard" isn't an exception to this. Everyone at Ritza works smart. If you've found a way to be more productive in less time, then share it with the team.
- Don't plagiarize or outsource your work. Sometimes you might be assigned work that already exists. This doesn't mean you can copy-paste it, that's plagiarism, which is dishonest. 
- This includes being honest about any problems you're facing. If you have a personal crisis, or anything else that stops you fulfulling your agreement, then tell us with as much notice as possible.


### Initiative

You should take initiative.

- This isn't the kind of job where you can wait around waiting to be assigned work. Everyone the team is proactive in finding ways to add value, or asking if they're not sure what they should be doing in a given hour, day, or week.

### Don't do anything that would be added to this list 

- This list is longer than it looks here. General 'play nice' rules apply implicitly. Feel free to suggest a code of conduct we can use that covers things like discrimination, harassment, and other no-nos. [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/handbook/code-of-conduct) has a fairly generic one that faced some controversy in the past, but is probably a good starting point.

## Partly-negotiable expectations

### Stick to terms of your contract

If you're on a retainer with us that specifies that you will give Ritza a certain amount of time each month, you should have a very high confidence that you can give those hours to Ritza. Our retainer agreements are often structured as 

* X hours / month
* Spread approximately equally each week

This means if you have a 40 hour retainer with us, you should aim to do 10 hours/week. 

We know that you have a life outside of Ritza, and for exceptional circumstances we will always be understanding and flexible, but just as we commit to paying your for those hours, we expect you to commit to providing them.

If you can't provide us with the contracted hours, you should let us know with as much notice as possible. If you can't give us the hours in the expected week and want to make them up the next week, then let us know _as early as possible_. If you haven't done your hours in a given month and aren't going to invoice for them  you need to inform us _in advance_.

While our business model is based around selling words instead of hours, it's still very important to us that we don't cheat any of our customers of value. We often provide our customers with more words than our contracts stipulate, especially if some of the words are 'easier' than other words, so even if you've written more words in less time, this does not mean that we won't miss the extra hours. 

### Stick to our normal working hours

If you're a full time employee, your contract stipulates Monday to Friday, 9am - 5pm SAST as Ritza's standard working hours. In nearly all cases, this is when you should be putting in your Ritza hours. If you need to do something else in those hours and you want to make use of flexitime, then tell us. 

Unlike most other agencies we have always avoided 'crunchtime' where people are asked to work extra hours, evenings, or weekends, to meet deadlines and we plan to keep it this way. Predictability is a necessary part of this, so if you're feeling like you're falling behind on expected output (but you've been putting in the agreed hours) then tell us, don't try to 'catch up' by working evenings or weekends.

Again, if you have individual preferences of when you want to do your Ritza hours, discuss it with us and we can likely accommodate requests.

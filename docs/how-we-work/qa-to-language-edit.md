Once a file has gone though [QA](./qa-and-screenshots-role.md), it is ready for language editing.

For example, here the QA pull request has been prepared.

This is a request to merge the branch containing QA changes into the branch that everyone is collaborating on for this specific article.
In this case, the author was working outside of git, so the 'QA' step includes adding the original draft.

You can merge the `qa-prediction-engine` branch into the `add-predictive-text-engine` branch and then navigate to that branch.

The navigate to the place in the structure where the tutorial has been added (tutorials -> 17-predictive-text-engine)

https://github.com/ritza-co/replit.github.io/blob/add-predictive-text-engine/tutorials/17-predictive-text-engine.md

And you can edit in GitHub there - or create a Replit, clone the whole repository and switch that branch to make edits using Replit if you prefer.

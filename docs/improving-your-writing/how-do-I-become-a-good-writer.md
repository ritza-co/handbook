Many people ask us how to become a writer. Here's an opinionated guide.

Some resources can help though (as long as you are writing too. The best is to read and write. If you don't have time, rather just write.

Many people try to learn something without doing it - by watching others, reading guides, buying courses. If you want to ignore one section in this document,

even more can be useful.

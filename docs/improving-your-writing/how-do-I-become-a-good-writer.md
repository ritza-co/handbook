# How do I become a good writer?

Many people ask us how to become a writer. Here's an opinionated guide.

## Year 1: write (yes, there are no shortcuts unfortunately).

The best resource is [docs.new](https://docs.new) or other text editor of your choice. Write. Preferably a lot. 

> The first million words are the hardest.

> The right process for you is a process which gets you to write 250k words this year.

> It's almost inconceivable to have delta in a process which would make 250k words with Process A less successful than 25k words with Process B, but that level of difference in output is legion.

## Year 1: read

Many people try to learn something without doing it - by watching others, reading guides, buying courses. If you want to ignore one section in this document, 
ignore this one and take note only of the previous one. That said, if you're actively practicing, getting some advice from people who have actively practiced 
even more can be useful.

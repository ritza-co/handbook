# Onboarding to Ritza

Welcome to Ritza! We're looking forward to working with you. Here's some information to get you started, but remember we value **over-communication**. Please reach out to anyone at Ritza in any of the Slack channels at any time (the more often, the better) and ask to have a call whenever you need.

## Slack channels

You've probably been added to some Slack channels. We like sharing information [as widely as appropriate](https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/communication-guidelines/#share-information-as-widely-as-might-be-relevant) so feel free to use the Team channel as much as you like, any `ritza-<project>` channels you are working on, or your `ritza-<name>` channel if you prefer.

## Some housekeeping

- You will have at least weekly 1:1 meetings with Gareth or Sarah, and others as required to discuss your work. 
- You should have a shared Google Doc for keeping notes during these meetings. You're encouraged to add any questions or things you want to work through in the meetings. See more at [https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/one-on-ones/](https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/one-on-ones/). 
- You should keep a basic timesheet recording how many hours you work per day, and on what projects. You can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ScXlKUlj9Wz_bqUu4iuwpwqU8Xzzc8_qTQK_SZd1AWE/edit#gid=0) or something similar.
- If you are an independent contractor, you need to [invoice us](https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/invoicing-guidelines/), so make sure you are aware of the dates and details there to get paid.

## Getting started with projects

- Share your GitHub handle in your channel so you can be added to any relevant repositories
- Ask for any credentials that you need, and a CleanshotX license key if relevant

If you haven't used markdown before, take a tutorial. Anyone will do, e.g. 

- [https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Git is complicated! Don't feel bad asking for help, even with 'basic' questions.

## Internship goals 

Your internship is for you to gain experience and help us with real world projects for a limited time (often one month). In the last week of the internship, you'll do a presentation explaining what you worked on, what you think went well, and what you think could have gone better.

Often, our interns apply for contract or full time roles with us after the internship is complete. We'll get to know you better during the internship and assess you on your technical, writing, and professional skills to figure out if you're a good fit for Ritza longer-term.

## Ask questions and over communicate 

We cannot stress enough how important it is to keep in contact with us. We all work remotely, so it's very easy for someone to be 'forgotten' if they are not vocal in Slack. If you get stuck on something, let us know! If you aren't stuck, share progress anyway! Ask questions. A lot.

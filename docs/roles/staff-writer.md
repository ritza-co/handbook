## Staff Engineering Writer - Backend (Python, Django)

- üåê Global
- üí∞ Rate: ZAR 40k-50k/month (contract position, 40h/week)

We're looking for a staff Engineering Writer. You'll build proof-of-concept applications and write about how you did it, while also working on developing software for Ritza using Python and Django.

### What we offer

* A globally distributed, asynchronous work environment. We communicate mainly on Slack, with occasional Zoom calls. We are guided by [our principles](https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/principles/) which describe in more detail our focus on crafting.
* Greenfield projects: internally and the applications you will develop for guides and tutorials are tech-debt free. Start a new project and write your own code without needing to deal with team politics, technical debt, or dated internal tooling.

### What we are looking for

You should have some experience as a professional softare engineer, developing software that runs in a production setting. You should be able to pick up new tools, frameworks, and languages easily. You should have some experience writing: a personal blog, technical documentation, or anything else. We can help you improve your writing skills, but for this position we are looking for someone who has some existing experience too.

Apply by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/iWTKqA6cgzKePGoL7) (note it is a generic form we use for all applications so some fields may not apply).

Email editor@ritza.co if you have questions with 'STAFF ENGINEERING WRITER' as a subject.

[We are also hiring for several existing and future projects, so feel free to fill out the form if you‚Äôre interested in tech writing even if you‚Äôre not a perfect fit.]

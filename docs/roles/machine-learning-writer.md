Build fun proof-of-concept apps, share your expertise with the world, and get paid, while improving your writing skills.

You’ll code small projects and teach others how you did it. All of our work is made freely available to the world. Work with a team of experienced writers and editors, in a flexible, asynchronous, fully remote environment.

You should have at least some professional experience with coding and some experience with writing, even if it’s just a personal blog. Ideally you have experience with *production* machine learning, from designing experiments through to shipping them at scale.

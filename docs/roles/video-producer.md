[Ritza.co](https://ritza.co) is looking for someone who can record and produce technical videos. 

You

* Have some software engineering experience (the material we produce is very technical, and the audience are software engineers)
* Have some experience recording and editing videos (e.g. OBS, Camtasia, or equivalent)
* Have access to hardware (Doesn't have to be studio-level, but a high-resolution monitor and good sound card)

You will record yourself walking through our text-based tutorials, building and configuring applications while sharing your screen. 

In most cases, we will have existing text-based tutorials that you can walk through, so you won't need expertise in each language, but you will need to be able to set up various languages and other software on your own machine while walking through the guide.

See some [examples](https://codecapsules.io/docs/videos/).

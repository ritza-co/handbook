## Part Time Technical Editor 

We're looking for a part time technical editor to edit technical documentation for the software industry.

### Who we are

Ritza is a technical writing agency. We create documentation, blog posts, guides, ebooks, and other technical materials, usually for software engineers. We cover topics like software engineering, machine learning, devops, and more.

We work fully remotely, but most of the team is based in South Africa where we also meet up in person at least once per year.

We communicate mainly on Slack, and work largely asynchronously.

### What we are looking for

We need someone to help us with:

* Editing technical documentation not produced by us. Usually this needs more work than the documentation we produce ourselves, and occasionally needs overwriting. 
* Proofreading technical documentation and guides that we produce. Usually this only needs a quicker edit and second pair of eyes.

The work we do is very technical. You don't need to know how to code for this role, but you should ideally be familiar with technical terminology such as 'Python', 'JavaScript', 'YAML', 'GitHub', or be willing to learn. 

We work in several formats, but primarily in Markdown and GitHub, so you'll need to be technically savvy, and either have some experience with GitHub and Markdown, or be willing to quickly learn.

Our standard work hours are 09h00 - 17h00 SAST. While some of the work can be done outside of those hours, we are looking for someone who has at least some availability to overlap and collaborate with our team.

Initially we are looking for around 20-40 hours/month, but this has the potential to grow into a bigger retainer or a full time role.

## How to apply

Fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/nuXSRkFNVFnFsx3CA). Include the word 'unicorn' in the second-last field so that we know you read this, that you pay attention to detail, and that you aren't a bot. Email editor-at-ritza-dot-co with any questions.

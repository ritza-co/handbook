# Information and tips for applying to Ritza

We get more applications than we can process or respond to. We do not have an HR team. The upside of this is that if we engage with you after reviewing your application, you will immediately get personal attention from a decision maker. We won't make you jump through hoops for weeks or months just to ghost you at the end of the process. 

The downside of this is that we do not have the capacity to respond to every single applicant. If you apply and do not hear back from us, please consider your application unsuccessful. We keep all applicants on file and regularly reach out to existing applicants months or years later if a future role looks like a good fit.

Here are some things you can do to ensure you application is **unsuccessful**.

## Spam us regularly and on multiple channels

If you follow up on your application after a few hours or a few days, or try to contact us on multiple channels (Slack, email, filling out the form multiple times, or doing anything to try unfairly get more of our attention than other applicants), we will put your application to the back of the queue.

## Apply in a way that is not the way we ask you to apply

If we ask you to apply by filling out our application form and you instead email your CV and say that you are applying, but do not the fill out the form, we will not consider your application. If you write a DM on Slack saying 'hi', we will probably ignore you. If you write on Slack saying "hi I am interested in the job", we will probably ignore you. If you write "hi is this position still available?" on Slack, we will probably ignore you.

## Leave most of the fields in the form blank

We say that you can leave out fields that do not seem relevant, but if you leave out many or most of the fields we will probably ignore your application.

## Send a very very long CV

Your CV should ideally be one page long. The most relevant information (previous experience and highest level of education) should be at the top. If your CV is 8 pages about your primary school and the fact that you have 10 years of technical writing experience is hidden on page 8, we'll probably ignore your application.

## Send a very very short CV

If you CV has two sentences with hardly any information about your education or previous work experience, we will ignore your application.

## Add to this form

If you do anything that gets added to this page (they are all real examples), we will probably ignore your application.

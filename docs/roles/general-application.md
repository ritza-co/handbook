[Ritza.co](https://ritza.co) is looking for writers. Our engineering writers are people who are interested in both software engineering and writing. We produce technical tutorials, guides, ebooks, and other educational materials, with an emphasis on the *technical* side -- most of our articles contain code samples, so engineering skills are required. Writing experience is preferred, but our team can help you learn if you have a strong interest in writing.

### About the role

- üåê Globally distributed company (provide your own laptop, internet, and a quiet space to work). We are legally based in the Netherlands, but most of the team in South Africa, split between Cape Town and Joburg.
- üïê Flexible hours. We work maily asynchronously over Slack, but you will have a weekly [one-on-one](https://ritza.co/handbook/how-we-work/one-on-ones/) for mentorship and discussing your work. We usually work on a retainer basis (x hours/month for a fixed monthly rate), but we can also structure contracts per article or per hour in some cases.
